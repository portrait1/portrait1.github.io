<p>If you're a beginner it's a great way to learn the rules and get comfortable using online casino software without risking any money. You might want to test out new games you've never played before and don't want to risk your bankroll.</p>
<p>A lot of people just like the excitement of the games themselves and don't need to bet money for it to be fun. Whatever your reason and whatever your favorite game, you can play it for free right here.</p>

          <header><h2>Download VS. No-Download Casino Games</h2></header>
          <main>
            <p>
              When online casinos first came out you had to download the software and install it on your computer in order to play the casino's games. Nowadays, however, you don't have to do any of that.
              You can play casino games for free or real money using your computer, phone or tablet's internet browser.
              So which is better: download or no-download online casino games? The answer to that depends on your preference and how you like to play online games.
            </p>
             <h3>No-Download Casino Games</h3>
            <p>The biggest factor is convenience. By playing right on the casino's website you don't have to download or install an app.
            Since you're playing in your browser it won't take up memory on your device or slow down its performance.
            Play in your browser also guarantees that you're using the most recent version of the casino's software.
            There are never any updates to download & install, and ... <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/cookies">no cookies</a>!.</p>
            <h3>Download casino games</h3>
            <p>A downloaded casino app can offer more functionality than their website version.  By 'breaking out of the webbrowser', the downloaded casino app can use your computer or mobile operating system to the fullest.
            Sometimes it's as simple as better graphics and controls.</p>

              This is the casinoselfie checklist to make sure the games are top quality. 
              Obviously, the free casino games listed on our site have already passed these important tests.</p>

                  <summary>Graphics</summary><p>These days, the best online casino games look more like cutting-edge video games than the simple slots and video poker machines from old-school casinos. The best and most modern games have beautiful art and animations that make the gaming experience way more enjoyable.</p>

          <header><h2>Variety of Casino Games</h2></header>
          <main>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages that online casinos have over brick and mortar casinos is that size doesn't matter.
              Where a casino in Las Vegas needs to have physical space for 10 poker tables and 1000 slot machines the online casinos have no such limits! 
              They can add as many games as they like and you are always guaranteed a seat at any slot machine or table game.</p>
            <p>Our games section is packed with traditional games like <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/blackjack">blackjack</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/roulette">roulette</a>, craps, and poker. 
              Different brands each have their own unique style of play and you may find you like the Betsoft Blackjack game better than the Realtime Gaming version.</p>
            <p>The <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/spilleautomater">slots</a> section is the busiest area of the casino with over 600 casino games to choose from. 
              Themed games are especially popular with games like Game of Thrones slot games leading the way. 
              Every month there seems to be a new theme game added to the slot games section.
            </p>
    
            <dl>
              <dt><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/spilleautomater">Slots</a></dt>
    <dd><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/spilleautomater">Slots</a> are simple, just choose the number of coins and paylines you want to play and hit spin. The reels choose symbols at random and when they match on a payline, you win. There are also special symbols that trigger exciting bonus games.
        From more traditional and simple three-reel machines to fast-paced, complex video slots, there's something that will appeal to all kinds of gamers.</dd>
    
    <dt><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/blackjack">Blackjack</a></dt>
    <dd><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/blackjack">Blackjack</a> is one of the best games to play for free because there's so much strategy to learn. The better you play, the better your odds are of winning.
        Play free blackjack online to learn and practice without risking a cent. Develop your skills for free first and when you've got it mastered, deposit real money and reap the rewards.</dd>
    
    <dt><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/roulette">Roulette</a></dt>
    <dd><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://casinoselfie.com/no/roulette">Roulette</a> is a true casino classic. Place your bets on different numbers, colors, and combinations on the table and watch as the roulette wheel picks a winning number. If your number or color comes up, you win.
        The main types of roulette are American and European. If you have the choice, always play European roulette because the house edge is 2.7% compared to American roulette's 5.26%.</dd>
    
    <dt>Baccarat</dt>
    <dd>Even though the scoring and dealing are a bit confusing, baccarat is actually the easiest game in the entire casino. Just bet on whether the player or the banker's hand will win, or if they will tie. That's it.
    Playing baccarat for free on the internet is a great way to learn how the game works and to practice special baccarat strategies. Just remember to never bet on a tie, no matter what superstitious gamblers might tell you.</dd>
    
    <dt>Craps</dt>
    <dd>Unlike baccarat, playing craps can be really confusing at first. That's why playing craps for free online is the perfect way to learn all the rules without any of the risks.
    Each round starts with what's called a “come-out roll”. Most players bet on the “pass line” and if a 7 or 11 is rolled those bets win. If a 2, 3 or 12 hits, aka “craps”, pass line bets lose. If any other number is rolled it becomes the “point” number. Pass line bets win if the point number is rolled before a 7 hits.
    When the point or a 7 is rolled, a new round begins with a new come-out roll.
    This is just the start of what's available to bet on in craps, not to mention the strategies and systems you can use to improve your odds of winning.</dd>
    
    <dt>Video Poker</dt>
    <dd>Video poker has been really popular in land casinos for decades and the online versions are even better.    
    There are lots of different video poker variations but they're all based on classic five-card draw poker. The goal is to keep some cards and exchange others to make the best possible five card poker hand. The bigger the hand, the bigger the payout.    
    Similar to blackjack, it pays to learn proper strategy when you're playing video poker. If you learn to use the best strategies you can lower the house edge to less than 1%.</dd>

            <p>The country that you're in while playing online casino games will greatly affect your choices.</p>
            <p>Players living in the United Kingdom are permitted to only play in UK licensed casinos. Likewise many online casinos, and casino software brands, will block players from the United States from playing their games.</p>
            <p>This has led to some frustration as a player will click to play a game and find out they are rejected because the game is not served in their country.</p>
